# Snippr


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
- NodeJS 8.x


## Running this app

```bash
# create and activate virtualenv
mkvirtualenv -p python3 [name of your virtualenv] -a .

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

# django stuff
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py migrate

# run backend server
python manage.py runserver

# build and watch changes to frontend code
npm run build:watch
```


## Serving static files

After running `collectstatic`, all static files will be stored in the `static-root`
directory. This directory needs to be served separately using any file server,
although I would recommend using `nginx`.

Running `collecstatic` will store all static files into the `static-root` directory. This directory
needs to be served separately using any file server. In my case, I am using nginx.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
# perform "Configure nginx" step in the next section

sudo service nginx restart
```

### Configure nginx

Create the file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/snippr` with the
following contents:

```
server {
    # you may use any available port that you want
    listen 9001;

    location / {
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';
        autoindex on;

        # change the path to point to your own static-root
        root /home/emilarran/Documents/school/final-snippr/static-root;
    }
}
```

### Environment variables

By default, the app assumes that the static files are served at `localhost:9001`.

If this is not your case, e.g. you changed the nginx port to be something else,
you have to tell the app about it by setting the `STATIC_URL` environment
variable before running the server and building the static files.

```bash
export STATIC_URL=http://localhost:9000
python manage.py runserver

# and on another terminal

export STATIC_URL=http://localhost:9000
npm run build:watch
```
